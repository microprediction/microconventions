Sugar on top of the MUID package. 

Brief notes:

- Hash defined here: https://github.com/microprediction/muid/blob/master/muid/crypto.py


- Conversion to animal here; https://github.com/microprediction/muid/blob/master/muid/validation.py

- Then basically the miner just tries to hit the corpus. See L113 onwards: https://github.com/microprediction/muid/blob/0deb38fee9b1d396200a72db56bb19d9eef19c74/muid/mining.py#L113


I use a little sugar on top of the MUID package for microprediction which you can find in https://github.com/microprediction/microconventions/blob/master/microconventions/key_conventions.py

I should write this up somewhere
